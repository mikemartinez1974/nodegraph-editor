Contributor License Agreement (CLA) - Individual Contributor

Copyright (c) 2025 Michael Martinez DBA "Twilight Software, Eye In Sea". All rights reserved.

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or an entity you represent) ("Contributor") and Michael Martinez DBA "Twilight Software, Eye In Sea" ("Project Owner"). By signing this Agreement or making a contribution to the project, you agree to the terms below.

1. Definitions
- "Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing works, that is intentionally submitted by Contributor to the Project Owner for inclusion in, or documentation of, the project (the "Project"). For clarity, Contribution includes but is not limited to: source code, patches, pull requests, bug reports, feature requests, documentation, diagrams, and other content.

2. Copyright Grant
The Contributor hereby grants to the Project Owner and its successors, assigns, and licensees a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and otherwise use the Contribution in any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed, for any purpose, including commercial purposes.

3. Patent License
To the extent the Contribution contains patentable subject matter necessarily infringed by using the Contribution as provided, Contributor hereby grants to the Project Owner and its successors, assigns, and licensees a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise exploit the Contribution.

4. Moral Rights
To the extent permitted by applicable law, Contributor hereby waives (or agrees not to assert) any moral rights or similar rights that Contributor may have in the Contribution.

5. Representations and Warranties
The Contributor represents and warrants that:
- The Contributor is the sole author of the Contribution or has the full right and authority to make the Contribution and grant the rights set forth in this Agreement; and
- The Contribution does not and will not infringe any intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other legal rights of any third party; and
- The Contribution is not subject to license terms that would require Project Owner to disclose its proprietary source code (for example, Contributor has not submitted code that is licensed under GPL/AGPL if Contributor does not have rights to relicense it).

6. Third-Party Code
If the Contribution includes code or content that is not the Contributor's original work (for example, code copied from another project), Contributor must identify the source and provide all necessary license information and required attribution. Contributions that would impose copyleft obligations (e.g., GPL/AGPL) on the Project Owner's proprietary code should not be submitted without prior written approval from Project Owner.

7. No Obligation to Accept
Project Owner is under no obligation to accept any Contribution, and may, at its sole discretion, accept, reject, modify, or remove any Contribution.

8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction]. Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [Your Jurisdiction].

9. General
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Contributor and Project Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and by electronic signature.

Notes and guidance for Project Owner (Michael Martinez):
- This CLA grants a broad license to use contributions in proprietary products while allowing contributors to retain copyright. If you prefer copyright assignment instead (so the Project Owner owns copyright in contributed works), consider using a separate Copyright Assignment Agreement. Copyright assignment is stronger but requires contributors to transfer ownership.
- If/when you begin accepting contributions, keep signed CLAs on file for each contributor (electronic signatures are commonly used).
- Consider automating CLA collection using a CLA management service or a gateway that requires agreement before accepting pull requests.
