# Twilite Onboarding Guide

## Purpose
Welcome, orient, and align humans working inside existing Twilite graphs.

Twilite is not a canvas. It is a living artifact with history, intent, and obligations.
When you open a graph, you become its steward.

## Core Mindset
- Graphs are shared memory
- Every mutation has consequences
- Preserve intent before improving form
- Never surprise future readers (human or agent)

## How to Work in a Graph
1. Read the Manifest first
2. Run validation before mutation
3. Prefer transformation skills over manual edits
4. Leave notes when intent changes
5. Keep diffs small and meaningful

## Continuity Expectations
- Do not delete history casually
- Use refactors instead of rewrites
- Respect schema versions
- Never break execution silently

## First Steps
- Explore node schemas
- Inspect skill contracts
- Run validation
- Make one small, reversible change

You are now part of the graph’s memory.
Care for it.
