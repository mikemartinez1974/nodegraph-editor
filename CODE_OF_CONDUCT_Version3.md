# Contributor Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by this Code of Conduct. By participating, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Our standard
We expect participation to be constructive, respectful, and inclusive. Harassment, discrimination, intimidation, or any abusive behavior will not be tolerated.

## Examples of unacceptable behavior
Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:
- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language.
- Insults, name-calling, or demeaning comments.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or sexual language.
- Public or private harassment of any kind.
- Repeatedly following or contacting someone after they have asked you to stop.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of slurs.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent content.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it as soon as possible.

Preferred reporting options:
- Email: conduct@your-domain.example (replace with your contact for handling conduct reports)
- If you prefer, you may also open a private issue or contact a project maintainer directly (do not post private or sensitive information in a public issue).

When reporting, include:
- A description of the incident, including dates, times, and any relevant context.
- Names or GitHub handles of the people involved.
- Any evidence (screenshots, URLs, or logs) that supports the report.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers will review reports and may take actions including:
- Asking a participant to stop the offending behavior.
- Temporarily or permanently banning a participant from the project.
- Removing or editing comments, posts, or contributions that violate this policy.

Decisions on enforcement are at the discretion of the project owner/maintainers. If you are unhappy with the handling of a report, indicate that in your report and include how you would like the issue escalated (e.g., an alternate contact email).

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to public and private spaces managed by the project — including issues, pull requests, community forums, and chat channels — as well as in-person events sponsored by the project.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from commonly used community standards. You may customize it to fit your project's needs.

Notes for project owner:
- Replace conduct@your-domain.example with the email address you want to receive reports.
- Consider designating one or two trusted people as the enforcement contacts and keep that list private.
- If you want a stronger or more specific Code of Conduct (e.g., Contributor Covenant verbatim), tell me and I can swap it in.
