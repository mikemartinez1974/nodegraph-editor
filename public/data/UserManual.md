## 🧠 Smart Node Types

Here’s when to use each type:

- **DefaultNode**: All-purpose visual box. Use for most ideas.
- **DivNode**: Add raw HTML or markdown blocks.
- **MarkdownNode**: Rich text, notes, and documentation.
- **APINode**: Call APIs and preview responses.
- **CounterNode**: Track increments, quantities, or states.
- **TimerNode**: Useful for timelines or stopwatch logic.
- **ScriptNode**: Run code on your graph.
- **GateNode**: Logic flows (AND, OR, XOR, etc.).
- **DelayNode**: Introduce intentional pauses.
- **ToggleNode**: Simple ON/OFF states.
- **SvgNode**: Add inline vector graphics.
- **FixedNode**: Small labels/icons that stay fixed.

### Pro Tip

Use **MarkdownNode** for step-by-step instructions directly in the graph. Or nest **ToggleNodes** inside **Groups** for collapsible workflows.

## ➿ Edge Types Cheat Sheet

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Child / Parent | Hierarchies (trees, outlines) |
| Peer | Sibling nodes (e.g., teams, features) |
| Data Flow | Show movement of info or inputs |
| Dependency | Requirements or order dependencies |
| Reference | Documentation links |
| Bidirectional | Mutual relationships |
| Weak Link | Optional or inferred relationships |
| Strong Link | Must-have connections |

## 🧩 Scripting Magic

Scripts run in a secure sandbox—great for data processing or procedural generation.

---

## 🗂️ Groups

Group related nodes for:

- Collapsible views  
- Organizing by theme or workflow  
- Managing complexity  

Each group can be styled, labeled, and edited just like a node.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

- **Graph doesn’t show?** Zoom out or click "Auto-Layout."  
- **Paste not working?** Check if JSON copied fully.  
- **Overlaps?** Ask AI: "spread out the layout more."  
- **Errors?** Validate JSON before pasting.

## 🧙 Pro Tips

- **Start small**: 5–10 nodes = fast iteration.  
- **Markdown everywhere**: Use it for notes, docs, or structure.  
- **Save often**: Don’t trust your browser session!  
- **Group to declutter**: Hide complexity till you need it.  
- **Undo is your friend**: Ctrl+Z gets you out of trouble.
