# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to report a security issue in the Twilight Node Browser. We take security seriously. This document describes how to report vulnerabilities and what to expect after you do.

1) Reporting a Vulnerability
- Preferred: Email security reports to: security@your-domain.example (replace with your preferred security contact).
- If you can't email, you may open an issue in this repository and mark it with the label "security-report"; however, emailing is preferred to avoid public disclosure.
- Do not include sensitive data in public issues. If you must, contact us by email first.

2) What to include in a report
- A clear description of the vulnerability and the affected versions.
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions, proof-of-concept code, or a test case if possible.
- The impact of the vulnerability and any attack surface details.
- Your contact information and PGP key (optional) for secure follow-up.

3) Response Process & Timeline
- Acknowledgement: We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.
- Triage: We will assess severity and scope within 7 business days and may request additional information.
- Fix & Disclosure: We aim to provide a fix or mitigation within a reasonable timeframe depending on severity. Coordinated disclosure will be agreed upon with the reporter; in general we follow responsible disclosure and will not publicly disclose an issue until a fix is available.

4) Supported Versions
- Only the versions listed in RELEASES.md or tagged releases are actively supported for security fixes. If a vulnerable version is no longer supported, we will indicate available mitigations or recommend upgrading.

5) Disclosure policy
- We will coordinate with the reporter on public disclosure. Reporters who follow this policy may be acknowledged by name unless they request anonymity.

6) Safe Harbor
- We ask that security researchers follow reasonable safe-harbor practices: test only on instances you own or have permission to test, avoid accessing or modifying user data, and avoid disruptive testing techniques. If you follow this policy in good faith, we will not initiate legal action against you for your good-faith security research.

7) Remediation and Releases
- Security fixes will be released as patches or new releases as appropriate. We will include details in the release notes when safe to do so.

8) Contact & PGP key
- Security contact: security@your-domain.example
- Optional PGP key for encrypted reports: <PGP public key or URL>

---

Notes for project owner:
- Replace security@your-domain.example with the email address you monitor for security reports.
- Consider adding a PGP key for secure communication.
- If you need a disclosure timeline (e.g., 90 days), add it under Response Process.
