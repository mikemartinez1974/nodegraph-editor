# __PLUGIN_NAME__

This folder was generated by the NodeGraph plugin starter CLI. It contains:

- `manifest.json` – declarative metadata, node definition, and permissions.
- `plugin.js` – sandboxed runtime bundle that registers RPC handlers via `NodeGraphPluginSDK`.

## Local development

1. Copy this folder into your running NodeGraph app under `public/plugins/__PLUGIN_SLUG__`.
2. Start `npm run dev` and open the Plugin Manager (puzzle icon).
3. Install the manifest by pasting `http://localhost:3000/plugins/__PLUGIN_SLUG__/manifest.json`.
4. Add the "Starter Node" from the Add Node menu to verify the declarative UI + placeholder are working.

## Next steps

- Replace the sample RPC methods in `plugin.js` with your own host calls.
- Update `manifest.json` with the nodes/panels you plan to ship.
- Use the Phase 3 node definition contract to declare new properties, badges, or ports.
- When you're ready to expose a custom renderer, follow the Plugin Platform roadmap for the upcoming runtime hooks.
