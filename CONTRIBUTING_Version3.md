Thank you for your interest in contributing. At this time the project is proprietary and contributions are accepted only under the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) located at CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md in the project root.

Before you open a pull request:
1. Read the CLA
   - You must sign the CLA and provide a copy of the signed agreement before a contribution will be merged.
   - To submit a signed CLA:
     - Preferred: attach a signed PDF or image of the signed signature page to the pull request, or
     - Email a signed copy to: [your-email@example.com] (replace with your preferred contact) and include the PR number in the email subject.
   - We keep signed CLAs on file for each contributor.

2. Check license compatibility
   - Do not submit third-party code licensed under copyleft terms (e.g., GPL, AGPL) unless you have the right to relicense it and you disclose the original source and license in your submission.
   - If your contribution incorporates third-party code, list the source and license in the PR and update THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.

3. Code style and tests
   - Follow the existing coding style in the repository.
   - Include tests for new functionality where applicable.
   - Run linting and tests locally before submitting.

4. What to include in a PR
   - A clear title and description of the change.
   - Link to an issue if applicable.
   - A checklist (see PR template) showing CLA attachment/acceptance, tests, and documentation updates.
   - If the contribution affects user-visible behavior, update relevant docs or the user manual.

5. Review process
   - Submissions are reviewed by the project owner.
   - The project owner may request changes or reject contributions at their discretion.
   - Contributions accepted under the CLA are licensed to the project owner per the CLA terms.

6. Contact / Questions
   - If you have questions about contributing, email: [your-email@example.com] (replace with your preferred contact).
