# Node Graph Modes

Your node graph supports three main modes for positioning nodes: **Manual**, **Nav**, and **Auto**.  
Each mode defines how node positions are set, updated, and displayed.

---

## 1. Manual Mode
- **Behavior**
  - Nodes are positioned explicitly by the user.
  - No automatic repositioning occurs.
- **Implementation Notes**
  - Store `x, y` (or `x, y, z` for 3D) per node.
  - Update coordinates when nodes are dragged or moved.
  - Disable all auto-layout or physics simulations.
- **Pros**
  - Full control.
- **Cons**
  - Tedious for large graphs.

## 2. Nav Mode (Dynamic Auto-Layout)
- **Behavior**
  - Nodes move dynamically around a selected node.
  - Positioning is determined by physics or force-directed layout.
- **Implementation Notes**
  - On each frame, calculate forces (spring/repulsion) between nodes.
  - Selected node can be pinned at center.
  - Use damping factors to keep movement smooth and stable.
- **Pros**
  - Intuitive exploration of relationships.
- **Cons**
  - Can feel chaotic with too many nodes.

## 3. Auto Mode (Algorithmic Layout)
- **Behavior**
  - Nodes are positioned by a chosen layout algorithm:
    - Hierarchical
    - Radial
    - Grid
  - Once laid out, nodes typically stay fixed until re-run.
- **Implementation Notes**
  - Provide layout options and spacing parameters.
  - Compute node positions from scratch using node relationships.
  - Allow re-running layout when graph changes.
- **Pros**
  - Neat and structured layouts.
- **Cons**
  - Less flexible than Nav Mode.

---

## Implementation Considerations
- Maintain a **mode state variable**:  
  let mode = "manual"; // "manual" | "nav" | "auto"
Only run the positioning logic for the active mode.

When switching from Nav/Auto → Manual, preserve the current node positions.

Smoothly interpolate positions when changing modes to avoid abrupt jumps.


Do you want me to also include a **pseudo-code class design** (like `GraphManager`) in this same markdow
